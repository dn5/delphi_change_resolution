Change screen resolution in Delphi
=============================

Old school code from 2k11 while I was still coding in Delphi. This function is rewritten from C IIRC and I need it for some remote administration tool I guess, that I wrote in Delphi years ago.

Pretty easy to see what I did because there are comments in-line with every argument. The best thing? **You don't need to restart your screen, it works in runtime**!!!

Code is old, I would advise you to change x, y to integers and not strings (I don't know why I put it that way). Hit me up on twitter if you need help.
